# Chinese News Classification

We all know that Chinese words are different than English. One particular difference is that a single Chinese character can be a word, and it can combine with another Chinese character to form a new word, which has a totally different meaning. In this case, I was interested in exploring how tokenizing works in Chinese nlp tasks. 

The task of this project is to classify the categories of Chinese news based on brief, keywords, and other data. I used the Bayes model, Bag-of-words model, TF-IDF model, and RNN model in this project. The highest accuracy score I got is 0.69. I appreciate discussions and suggestions to improve the accuracy.
