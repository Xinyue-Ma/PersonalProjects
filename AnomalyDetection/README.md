# Anomaly Detection

This is a project under [data mining](https://github.com/datawhalechina/team-learning-data-mining/tree/master/AnomalyDetection). Rescourse are from DataWhale Community. The target is to apply principles of traditional anomaly detection methods using Python. 

## Tasks:
### Task01: Introduction to Anomaly Detection (2 days)
- The basic concepts of anomaly detection
- The basic methods of anomaly detection
### Task02: Statistics-based method (3 days)
- Anomaly detection method based on Gaussian distribution
- Non-parametric anomaly detection methods
- Master the HBOS algorithm
### Task03: Linear model (3 days)
- Linear regression
- The anomaly detection method of principal component analysis
### Task04: Method based on similarity (3 days)
- Distance-based anomaly detection methods
- The density-based LOF algorithm
### Task05: Integration method (3 days)
- The basic concepts of integration method
- The principle of feature bagging
- The isolated forest algorithm
