# Introduction to Anomaly Detection
## What is anomaly detection? Why this is important?
Anomaly detection aims to help detect events that are rare or are different from the norm. This is a important area in the financial industry. For example, in consumer banking, anomalies might be credit card fault. In other cases, an anomaly might be something that create a great investment opportunity for investors. 

## What are the applications of anomaly detection? What business problems are you looking to solbe?
There are many applications that can be posited as uses of anomaly detection. For example, a financial analyst changes their buy/hold/sell rating on a particular stock following the company's quarterly earnings announcement. When an analyst changes their rating, the event in itself is not as important as knowing the understanding the context. Was this analyst expected to change their rating? Were they simply moving towards the market's expectations? Do markets typically move when this analyst changes their rating? Recasting this problem in the framework of anomaly detection forces us to take the relevant context into account and leads to interpretations that make sense.
