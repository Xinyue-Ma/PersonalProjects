### Stock Price Movement Prediction
1. Using Python to perform data preprocessing and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) for energy commodities (e.g. CL, NG, HO) with visualization by pandas and Matplotlib.

2. Utilizing Feature Engineering include Window Function, Velocity Features, One-hot Encoding, Frequency and Pivot Table.

3. Developing Machine Learning models (e.g. Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict abrupt market moves from CFTC reports, evaluated modelsâ€™ performance (e.g. AUC, confusion matrix).

4. Improving prediction performance via XGBoost model in Python with hyperparameter tuning (pruning, decision thresholds, and different class weights for imbalanced data), current test set precision is 85% and recall rate is 76%.
