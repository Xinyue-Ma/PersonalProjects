## Description
### Credit Scoring

### Credit Rating

### Default Detection
Credit Risk Modeling Utilizing Advanced Data Analytics

1. Wrote various complex SQL queries to clean, integrate and analyze a variety of data sources from internal database and external third-party venders to generate predictive feature engineering (e.g. Velocity Features, Historical Data, Cross Sectional Analysis) to support the risk/modeling team.

2. Implemented Logistic Regression/Decision Tree Model to forecast over 1600 small business loan default behaviors, used various statistical methods (IV, Marginal KS, VIF, XGboost) to select the top features and successfully identified 35 features to use.

3. Worked with senior risk modelers to continue improving model performance by leveraging credit industry experts’ insights and explore new dataset (Tongdun score, Indicted times, Judgement Documents, Number of Inquiries) usage.

4. Wrote technical documentation on Sharepoint, identified a few code errors and collaborate with developer team on fixing production issue after reviewing over 1000 lines of code.
