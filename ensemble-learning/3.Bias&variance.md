## 作业
1. Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. bias=E(f_predict)-f

Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. variance=E(f_predict^2)-E(f_predict)^2
